API server get 'Create POD' request
Scheduler watches for event
Scheduler identify who can serve based on data available in etcd
    Node agent kubelet keeps publishing metric to API server
    API server publish to etcd
Scheduler feeds data to API server
API server talk to kubelet to create pod



Components using gRPC through streaming 

  - Scheduler for

Components using gRPC as RPC

Never run a pod directly. Always run deployment though it is more than pod template + replica count. It saves you from node crash.

Kubectl says create a deployment
Kube-apiserver gets request and writes to etcd saying its created
Kube-controller-manager (like a garage) discovers deployment
Kube-controller-manager takes template and request for pod creation
Kube-scheduler pitch in and find node to host pod
Kube-scheduler updates selected node to kubernetes master
Kube-apiserver calls kubelet to create pod
